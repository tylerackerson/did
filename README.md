# did
A dead-simple simple library for generating prefixed IDs that provide context to consumers and creators alike.

## `did`s are:
- **Distinct**, as all unique identifiers should be
- **Definite**: "free of all ambiguity, uncertainty, or obscurity," thanks to prefixes
- **Dang...** way easier to use than UUIDs `;)`

## usage
### creating a new, random did 
```
# a valid prefix is required
did, _ := did.New("us")
```

### creating a did from a UUID
```
u := uuid.New()
# a valid prefix is required
did, _ := did.DidFromUuid(u, "us")
```

### creating a did from a valid did string
```
did, _ := did.DidFromString("us-526cac357e74429beb4f2ecca56c571f")
```

## features
### implemented
1. Create random did given a prefix
1. Create did from UUID or properly-formatted string
1. Methods for String, Length
1. Validations for prefixes (alpha 2 or 3 characters)

### planned
1. built-in prefixes for common use-cases (e.g "users", "accounts")
1. More UUID interop: (e.g. comparison)
1. #Scan, #Value for DB reading + writing
1. performance / benchmarking
1. sorting?
1. other languages/ alphabets beyond English

### background
At the last company I worked for, I joined very early on when the product was a simple prototype / demo. I immediately saw an opportunity to simplify and standardize the database schema. I proposed common metadata fields for all records, implemented a migration strategy and tooling, decided on a standard approach to "soft-deleting" records (where necessary), and prioritized creating a standard approach for records IDs that would make records far easier to reason about than UUIDs. 

There was a stark contrast to the UUID-only approach we had versus what I was used to from working at Twilio: [What is a SID?](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-is-a-sid). And I knew that other developer-friendly companies took similar approaches. For example, Stripe also has prefixed IDs: [Designing APIs for humans: Object IDs](https://dev.to/stripe/designing-apis-for-humans-object-ids-3o5a). It turns out that Github and many others were doing the same: [Behind GitHubâ€™s new authentication token formats](https://github.blog/2021-04-05-behind-githubs-new-authentication-token-formats/). 

I proposed a solution to the rest of the engineering team, and all 4 of us agreed on the approach. So I created the `did` package for us internally, with some help from another founding engineer that had deep Go knowledge. We decided on prefixes for all of our most common tables where records were exposed to end-users. Other tables, e.g. join tables continued using UUIDs. The migration from UUID to dids was fairly straightforward. It required "dual-writing" both UUIDs and dids to tables, some backfilling, and updating foreign keys and other indexes. The last step was to drop all of the UUID columns.
